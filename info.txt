Exception thrown while executing UI block: End users must be able to opt out of Mapbox Telemetry in your app, either inside Settings (via Settings.bundle) or inside this app. By default, this opt-out control is included as a menu item in the attribution action sheet. If you reimplement the opt-out control inside this app, disable this assertion by setting MGLMapboxMetricsEnabledSettingShownInApp to YES in Info.plist.

See https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/attribution/#mapbox-maps-sdk-for-ios for more information.

Additionally, by hiding this attribution control you agree to display the required attribution elsewhere in this app.
